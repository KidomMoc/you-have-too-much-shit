# YOU HAVE TOO MUCH SHIT

This is the original text of YOU HAVE TOO MUCH SHIT. For more information, see http://youhavetoomuchshit.com/

I've had several requests from people wanting to translate the text into different languages, so have made it available here.

## Two ways to contribute a translation

A. Create a new branch, duplicate the text file (re-name to the language you're translating to), and send a pull request once your translation is complete.

B. Download the file and send your translation to me, so that I can add it to the repository myself.

## Disclaimer

I should be clear that any versions other than the original English one are subject to changes made by others, so if you're reading in another language, it may not be exactly the same.

## Thank you

Thank you to all the nice people who've contributed translations.
